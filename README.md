# vscode-yangcraft README

Yet Another Extension for VS Code to work with YANG. This extension is a syntax highlighter for YANG data modeling files. Besides that, it also uses some useful snippets when writing YANG models.

## Features



## Requirements

This extension does not have any third-party dependency. It should work out-of-the box if you have a up-to-date VS Code.

## Known Issues

TBD

## Acknowledgement
